            <h3>What's the Problem?</h3>
            <p>
                Teenagers have been becoming more and more stressed and 
                have limited tools to deal with this stress. We have also
                seen an increase in teen suicide rates, which is alarming. 
                Stress can cause feelings of depression, anxiety, 
                irritability, as well as physical responses such as 
                headaches, and disrupted sleep. Stress levels tend 
                to be highest during the school year, but do not go away during 
                the summer. School is a large source of stress, but other 
                sources include the future (college and jobs), politics, 
                and more.

            <h3>What's Virtual Reality?</h3>
            <p>
                Virtual Reality (VR) consists of 3D environments, a 
                headset through which the user views the environment, and
                sensors to track the user movement in the room. The 
                user can also use a controller to interact with the 3D 
                environment. The idea is that VR should be fully 
                immersive so the user feels as though they are in the 
                3D environments. Currently, it has been used for 
                education, gaming, and therapy.

            <h3>Virtual Reality and Relaxation</h3>
            <p>
                Our team is planning to research and build a VR platform
                that will be implemented in High Schools. We chose VR as 
                a platform because of the ability to escape the school 
                stressful environment into the 3D environment (we call this 
                immersion). We are currently researching various sounds, 
                environments, companionship, and active vs. 
                passive states.

            <p>
                We are a team working at the University of Washington, 
                Seattle campus. We are composed of six undergraduates and 
                masters students focused on Human Centered Design & Engineering, 
                as well as professors in the HCDE department and School of Nursing.
